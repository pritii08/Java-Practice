# Java Practice & DSA Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning journey**.
It contains concept-wise Java programs, problem-solving practice, and logic-building exercises
that I solve regularly to strengthen my fundamentals and prepare for software development roles.

---

## 📌 Purpose of this Repository
- Build strong problem-solving skills using **Core Java**
- Practice **DSA and logical questions** step by step
- Maintain a **well-structured GitHub record** of my learning
- Prepare for **technical interviews and placements**

This repository reflects **consistency, clarity, and growth** rather than just final answers.
